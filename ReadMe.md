# Description

This To-Do List site is a very simple to do list that starts off with some items filled in. 
[To-Do List Site](https://captcalli.github.io/ToDoList/)

# Usage

Open the webpage, and either click on items to cross them out or press the x on the right to delete them. 
To add items: write them into the Text box (placeholder: Resistance is Futile) and add items by clicking "Make It So" or pressing the Enter button.

Once an item is crossed out, it will receive a checkmark on the left and be crossed out with a purple background. 
If you accidentally crossed an item out, simply uncheck the item and it will go back to normal.

# Interesting Tidbit
Did you know that Leatherback Sea Turtles are not only endangered, but are also the only sea turtle that lacks a hard shell?
